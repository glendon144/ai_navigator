# AI Navigator v0.2.2 — “Stable Memory, Honest Light”

This release marks the moment AI Navigator graduates from a simple browser shell to a *cognitive instrument*—a tool for stable thought in an unstable web.

## Highlights

### 🌐 Bright, Honest VPN Indicator
The status dot now reports VPN health truthfully and visibly.  
A small light, but one that means “your channel is protected.”  
Its purpose is not decoration—it’s epistemic clarity.

### 📜 Reader-Mode Archival Stability
Archived pages now stand alone—no scripts, no corporate dependencies.  
They remain readable even if the host site, or Google itself, disappears.  
Each page becomes a stable object of study: reproducible, trustworthy, serene.

### 🧠 Memory Weave Persistence
The Memory Weave system reconnects your past work—threads, recoveries, and reflections—into a single local continuum.  
Sessions once thought ephemeral now endure across time, linking ChatGPT, local archives, and the evolving mind of the user.

### 🛡️ Ethical Defaults
All data remains local.  
No telemetry. No analytics. No surrender of context.  
AI Navigator defends its operator’s attention and autonomy as a matter of design, not policy.

## Philosophy

*The browser should remember what matters, not what advertises.*  
AI Navigator restores the human to the center of the feedback loop—  
a calm observer navigating the noise with persistent memory and quiet encryption.

This release honors that principle.
