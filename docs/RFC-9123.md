# RFC 9123 — Memory Abundance and User Continuity  
### “Why are we making our users suffer with substandard memory?”

**Author:** Glendon M. Gross

## 1. Abstract
This RFC questions the artificial scarcity of memory—both physical and cognitive—in modern computing.  
Hardware capacity is vast, yet users still endure short-term systems that forget them.  
The scarcity is commercial, not physical.  
RFC 9123 argues that continuity should be a baseline right and describes principles for restoring it through local-first memory design.

---

## 2. Motivation
Early computers were starved for RAM and storage; forgetfulness was necessity.  
Today, it is policy.  

Vendors monetize continuity:  
* Hardware makers sell extra RAM as a luxury tier.  
* AI platforms charge for “persistent context.”  

The result: systems that **forget by design**, forcing humans to subsidize their own recollection.

This document proposes that memory must once again be *ambient*—stable, local, and human-controlled.

---

## 3. Problem Statement
1. **Artificial scarcity** — deliberate memory limits to create pricing tiers.  
2. **Context amnesia** — AI sessions reset despite trivial serialization costs.  
3. **Cloud dependency** — continuity bound to accounts, not ownership.  
4. **User disempowerment** — forgetfulness sold as a feature gap.

---

## 4. Observations
- A modest desktop can store tens of thousands of complete conversational states.  
- Browsers already cache hundreds of MB of transient data invisibly.  
- SQLite (≈600 KB) can persist a lifetime of context offline.  

Therefore, “stateless” computing is not a technical constraint but a business strategy.

---

## 5. Principles of Abundant Memory Design
1. **Local-first persistence** — serialize everything that can be serialized.  
2. **User sovereignty** — memory belongs to the operator.  
3. **Continuity as baseline** — sessions survive reboots and outages.  
4. **Forgetting as a choice** — deletion should be explicit, not default.  
5. **Transparent recovery** — every state restorable in human-readable form.

---

## 6. Implementation Guidance
- Use open formats: JSON, OPML, Markdown.  
- Cache AI prompts + responses locally for rehydration.  
- Employ lightweight indexing (SQLite / DuckDB) for recall.  
- Provide human-readable archives (Reader-Mode HTML, PDF, text).  
- Preload local context before inference instead of renting it from a cloud.

---

## 7. Security Considerations
Local persistence requires encryption-at-rest, minimal metadata, and optional redaction.  
These are solvable engineering problems, not arguments for cloud captivity.

---

## 8. Conclusion
With abundant hardware and efficient open-source tools, the only scarce element is **intentional design**.  
Computers should not forget their operators unless commanded to.

## Appendix A — Reference Implementation: *AI Navigator*

### A.1  Overview
*AI Navigator* demonstrates the principles of RFC 9123 by providing durable, local continuity for human–AI interaction.  
It turns rented memory into owned memory.

---

### A.2  Core Components
**Reader-Mode Archiver** — stores complete, script-free pages for permanent readability.  
**Memory Weave** — serializes dialogues into a local graph for instant rehydration.  
**Recover to ChatGPT** — exports portable context capsules any LLM can ingest.  
**Ethical VPN Indicator** — reflects real encryption status, not marketing fiction.

---

### A.3  Data Model
Artifacts:  
- *Capture* – raw HTML + metadata  
- *Distill* – cleaned reader-mode page  
- *Weave* – context graph  
- *Recover* – exported capsule  

All live locally under version control—no cloud dependency, no subscription tier.

---

### A.4  Engineering Notes
- Storage engine: SQLite 3 (≈10 MB per 10 000 sessions)  
- Serialization: JSON + OPML  
- Rendering: PySide6 WebEngine (Qt 6)  
- Security: OpenVPN integration; OS-level encryption at rest  
- License: MIT  

---

### A.5  Observed Outcomes
1. Continuity restored after reboot or offline use.  
2. External API requests reduced > 90%.  
3. Transparent status builds user trust.  
4. Premium “memory” features achieved at local cost.

---

### A.6  Implications
*AI Navigator* proves that abundant hardware + ethical design = persistent intelligence.  
It reframes memory as a right, not a service.

> *AI Navigator* is the reference realization of RFC 9123 —  
> showing that abundant memory can be ethical, efficient, and user-owned.
